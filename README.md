# Challenges I faced
 -Edit the credentials
   EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit
   sudo apt-get install vim
  
  rbenv: version `ruby-2.6.3' is not installed
  `solution: rbenv install 2.6.3`

  `undefined method 'signed_id' for nil:NilClass`
  this is caused by no record in the active storage
  solution: rails db:reset 

  State changed from starting to crashed
  error code=H10
  The above error was caused by typing error of variables
  instead of :amazon I typed :amazone in production.rb file

  web: rake db:migrate && bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p { PORT: -3000 } && bin/rails css:watch
